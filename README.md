Install Scapy:
pip install scapy


Explanation:
Argument Parsing:
The script uses argparse to parse command-line arguments for the network interface, target IP, and target port.

Packet Forwarding:
The forward_packet function checks if a packet's destination IP and port match the target IP and port. If they do, it prints the packet's details and forwards the (potentially modified) packet.

Sniffing Function:
The start_sniffing function starts sniffing on the specified network interface and processes each packet with forward_packet.

Main Function:
The main function sets up argument parsing and starts the sniffing thread.

Usage:
Run the script with root privileges:


"sudo python mitm_proxy.py -i eth0 -t 192.168.1.100 -p 80"
Replace eth0 with your network interface, 192.168.1.100 with the target IP, and 80 with the target port.

Important Considerations:
Legal and Ethical Use: Ensure you have permission to intercept and analyze the traffic. Unauthorized interception can be illegal and unethical.
HTTPS Traffic: This script does not handle HTTPS traffic, as it would require decrypting SSL/TLS. For HTTPS, consider using tools like mitmproxy with proper certificate installation.
Efficiency: This script is basic and may not handle large amounts of traffic efficiently. For robust MITM functionalities, tools like mitmproxy are recommended.
This script provides a simple example of intercepting and forwarding network packets for a specific IP and port using Python and Scapy. For more advanced capabilities, consider using specialized tools designed for network traffic interception and analysis.
